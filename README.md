## Mach Eight Sample Project

This project is to create a function that finds pairs of integers from a list that
sum to a given value, the function will take as input the list of numbers as well as the target sum.

to test the function you have to install jest, that is on the dev dependencies, and 
run "npm test".

If you want, you can change the inputs that the function is receiving, and you will notice that the function will continue working properly.

This algorithm is O(n).
